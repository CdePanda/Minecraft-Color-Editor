# Minecraft Color Editor

This is a WYSIWYG editor for the Minecraft chat format built on top of a UI based on React.

### Experimental
This is a very early version which has so far only been properly tested in the latest version of Chrome. Make sure to report issues.

The editor makes use of more recent Javascript APIs. Compatibility for older browsers is currently not planned.
